This is a relatively simple vending machine project.

It has multiple screens and allows the user to see a list of options, add money, purchase an item, and receive change.  

As is it takes only whole number amounts of dollars, and returns change in quarters, dimes, and nickels.  

It saves a log of each transaction out to a file, and can also print a listing of everything that has been bought since it was turned on.
There is also a command to refill the machine's stock and change.

All major commands are explained onscreen in the menus.  Listing of purchasesand refilling the machine are done in a hidden menu by entering 0 on the main menu.

Entering -2 on the main menu will end the program.
